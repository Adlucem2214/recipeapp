            <h2>Flavchemy Recipe Mobile App Case Study</h2>
            <p>The objective of this project was to design an intuitive, visually appealing recipe mobile app, called Flavchemy. The app is designed to help users discover new recipes, save their favorites, and explore ingredients and categories easily.</p>

            <h3>Design Goals</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide a user-friendly interface for discovering and saving recipes.</li>
                <li>Ensure the app is accessible across all mobile devices with responsive design.</li>
                <li>Highlight recipes with attractive imagery and easy-to-read steps.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Process</h3>
            <p>I began by researching similar apps to understand user expectations. Then, I created wireframes to plan the layout and navigation. These wireframes ensured users could quickly find recipes and navigate through categories with ease.</p>

            </div>

            <h3>Final Design</h3>
            <p>The final design uses a clean, modern aesthetic with a focus on high-quality imagery of recipes. The color palette is soft, ensuring the focus remains on the images. Special attention was given to ensure the steps are easy to follow, with clear buttons for saving and sharing recipes.</p>
